        Retrieve the historical transactions based on the provided query criteria.

        The transactions are sorted by the created_at date in reverse chronological order,

        count parameter. To get the next page of results, make a new request and use the created_at date
        from the last item of the previous page as the value for the to parameter.

        Note
        ----
        The API returns a maximum of 1,000 transactions per request.
