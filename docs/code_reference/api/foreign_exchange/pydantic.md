# Foreign Exchange Pydantic Models

In order to simplify and standardize the data that is passed between the client and the Revolut Business API, PyRevolut uses Pydantic models to define the structure of the data.
Below are the Pydantic models used by the `Foreign Exchange` endpoint.

---

::: pyrevolut.api.foreign_exchange.resources.ResourceForeignExchange

---

::: pyrevolut.api.foreign_exchange.get.GetExchangeRate
